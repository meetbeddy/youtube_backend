the number of expected bytes. The `status` property is set to `400`
and `type` property is set to `'request.aborted'`.

### request entity too large

This error will occur when the request body's size is larger than the "limit"
option. The `limit` property will be set to the byte limit and the `length`
property will be set to the request body's length. The `status` property is
set to `413` and the `type` property is set to `'entity.too.large'`.

### request size did not match content length

This error will occur when the request's length did not match the length from
the `Content-Length` header. This typically occurs when the request is malformed,
typically when the `Content-Length` header was calculated based on characters
instead of bytes. The `status` property is set to `400` and the `type` property
is set to `'request.size.invalid'`.

### stream encoding should not be set

This error will occur when something called the `req.setEncoding` method prior
to this middleware. This module operates directly on bytes only and you cannot
call `req.setEncoding` when using this module. The `status` property is set to
`500` and the `type` property is set to `'stream.encoding.set'`.

### too many parameters

This error will occur when the content of the request exceeds the configured
`parameterLimit` for the `urlencoded` parser. The `status` property is set to
`413` and the `type` property is set to `'parameters.too.many'`.

### unsupported charset "BOGUS"

This error will occur when the request had a charset parameter in the
`Content-Type` header, but the `iconv-lite` module does not support it OR the
parser does not support it. The charset is contained in the message as well
as in the `charset` property. The `status` property is set to `415`, the
`type` property is set to `'charset.unsupported'`, and the `charset` property
is set to the charset that is unsupported.

### unsupported content encoding "bogus"

This error will occur when the request had a `Content-Encoding` header that
contained an unsupported encoding. The encoding is contained in the message
as well as in the `encoding` property. The `status` property is set to `415`,
the `type` property is set to `'encoding.unsupported'`, and the `encoding`
property is set to the encoding that is unsupported.

## Examples

### Express/Connect top-level generic

This example demonstrates adding a generic JSON and URL-encoded parser as a
top-level middleware, which will parse the bodies of all incoming requests.
This is the simplest setup.

```js
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')

var app = express()

// parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }))

// parse application/json
app.use(bodyParser.json())

app.use(funct
